# 2. Round Simulation Logic Implementation (2024-06-01)

## Summary
- Implemented the core logic for simulating agent rounds, including agent sessions, feed scrolling, engagement, and belief updating.
- Modularized feed management, observation, and engagement logic for extensibility.
- Integrated round simulation into the main simulation manager.

## Implementation Details
- Created `simulation/agent_session.py`:
  - Defines `AgentSession` for a single agent's round, including feed scrolling, engagement, and belief updating.
  - Implements `UserFeedManager`, `UserFeedScrollManager`, and `UserEngagementManager` for modular feed, observation, and engagement logic.
- Updated `simulation/simulation_manager.py`:
  - Integrates round simulation by running an `AgentSession` for each agent per round.
- Design is modular and ready for future extension (e.g., LLM-based observation, richer engagement types).

## Testing
- Manual validation of round simulation with multiple agents.
- Verified that each agent's session runs as expected and integrates with the simulation manager.
- **Planned:** Add unit tests for agent session and round simulation logic.

## Remaining Work
- **Unit Tests:** Implement comprehensive unit tests for round simulation and agent session logic.
- **Docs:** Add usage examples and API documentation.
- **Extension:** Integrate LLM-based observation and richer engagement types in future iterations.
