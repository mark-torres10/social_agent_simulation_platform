# 2. Round Simulation Logic Implementation (2024-06-01)

## Summary
- Implemented the core logic for simulating agent rounds, including agent sessions, feed scrolling, engagement, belief updating, and activity recording stubs.
- Modularized feed management, observation, and engagement logic for extensibility, with stubs for LLM-based reasoning and memory integration.
- Refactored the Agent class to `agent/agent.py` with an extensible `update_beliefs` method.
- Improved metadata handling and type annotations throughout.
- Integrated round simulation into the main simulation manager.

## Implementation Details
- Created `simulation/agent_session.py`:
  - Defines `AgentSession` for a single agent's round, including feed scrolling, engagement, belief updating, and activity recording.
  - Implements `UserFeedManager`, `UserFeedScrollManager`, and `UserEngagementManager` for modular feed, observation, and engagement logic, with extensible stubs for LLM/memory.
  - Prints detailed debug output during belief updating for traceability.
- Updated `simulation/simulation_manager.py`:
  - Integrates round simulation by running an `AgentSession` for each agent per round.
- Refactored `Agent` class to `agent/agent.py`:
  - Added `update_beliefs` method for extensible belief management.
- Improved metadata and type handling in `FeedPost`, `FeedObservation`, and `UserEngagement`.

## Testing
- Manual validation of round simulation with multiple agents.
- Verified that each agent's session runs as expected and integrates with the simulation manager.
- Confirmed debug output and type correctness.
- **Planned:** Add unit tests for agent session, round simulation, and belief updating logic.

## Remaining Work
- **Unit Tests:** Implement comprehensive unit tests for round simulation, agent session, and belief updating logic.
- **Memory Integration:** Integrate memory manager and implement robust activity recording.
- **LLM/Extension:** Implement LLM-based observation and engagement logic.
- **Docs:** Add usage examples and API documentation.
