# 4. UI/Backend Connection Progress (2024-06-03)

## Summary
- The UI is now fully connected to the backend: configuration values (number of agents, number of turns) are passed from the UI to the backend and used to initialize the simulation only when the user clicks "Initialize Simulation".
- The main simulation entry point and round simulation logic have been refactored to use new data models (`Feed`, `FeedPost`, `FeedObservation`, `UserEngagement`) and explicit list type hints.
- The UI now displays real simulation results, with per-day (tabbed) and per-user (selectable) views, and supports running single or multiple rounds interactively.
- The MemoryManager has been refactored for robust database handling and is integrated with the simulation lifecycle.
- The remaining work is focused on advanced config, error handling, export, and polish.

## Implementation Details
- **UI/Backend Connection:**
  - Streamlit UI collects configuration (number of agents, number of turns) and passes it to the backend on initialization.
  - Simulation is only initialized when the user clicks the "Initialize Simulation" button.
- **Main Simulation Entry Point:**
  - Added `main.py` for CLI entry and refactored `SimulationManager` to use explicit list type hints for agents and results.
- **Data Model Refactor:**
  - Introduced and integrated new `Feed`, `FeedPost`, `FeedObservation`, and `UserEngagement` models throughout the simulation and agent session logic.
- **UI Results Display:**
  - UI now displays real simulation results, with per-day (tabbed) and per-user (selectable) views. Each round's results are shown, including agent profiles, feeds, observations, and engagements.
  - Users can run single rounds or full simulations interactively from the UI, and results are accumulated and displayed.
- **MemoryManager Refactor:**
  - MemoryManager now robustly handles database creation, batch operations, and is integrated with the simulation lifecycle. Data is persisted and can be extended for future export/reload features.

## Testing
- Manual validation of end-to-end UI/backend flow, including config, simulation, and results display.
- No automated or integration tests yet.

## Remaining Work
- **Advanced Config:** Support for agent personas, traits, and other settings in the UI/backend.
- **Error/Loading Handling:** Robust error and loading state handling in the UI.
- **Export:** Implement export of simulation results from backend to UI.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Implement manual and automated tests for the full flow.
- **UI/UX Polish:** Further UI/UX improvements and accessibility.
