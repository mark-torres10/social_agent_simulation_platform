# 3. UI First Pass Completion (2024-06-01)

## Summary
- Completed the first pass of the Agent Simulation Platform UI, implementing all planned sections with placeholder data and navigation.
- The UI is now fully stubbed and ready for future backend integration and extension.

## Implementation Details
- Created `/ui/app.py` as the main Streamlit entrypoint.
- Added stub components in `/ui/components/` for agent config, simulation config, user feed, network, and analysis.
- Simulation View:
  - Uses Streamlit `st.tabs` for days (5 tabs: Day 1â€“5).
  - Within each day, uses `st.tabs` for users (User 1, User 2).
  - For each user, displays a vertically stacked list of feed posts, each as an `st.expander` with stubbed post, agent thoughts, and actions.
  - This structure avoids nested expanders (per Streamlit API constraints) and provides intuitive, scalable navigation.
- All other sections (network summary, metrics, export) are present as stubs.

## Testing
- Manual validation of UI navigation and layout in Streamlit.
- Confirmed that all sections are present, navigation is intuitive, and no Streamlit API errors occur.
- Verified that the UI is ready for future backend integration.

## Remaining Work
- **Backend Integration:** Connect UI to real simulation logic and data.
- **UI Polish:** Add further visual enhancements, error handling, and accessibility improvements as needed.
- **Feature Extension:** Implement real-time updates, richer metrics, and user interaction features.
