    This function is intended to be called from Pydantic field_validators

    Args:
        v: The value to validate (expected to be str after Pydantic coercion,
           but defensively handles None and non-str types)
        field_name: The name of the field being validated (for error messages)

        The stripped string value

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the value is None, not a string, or empty after stripping
