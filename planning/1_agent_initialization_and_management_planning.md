# Agent Initialization and Management Plan

## Problem Statement
- The simulation platform requires a robust, extensible way to initialize and manage multiple agents, each with persistent characteristics (personality, beliefs, worldview, political views, etc.).
- The system must support both default and custom initialization of agent traits, and provide a unified interface for managing all agents in a simulation.
- The platform should be agnostic to agent internals, allowing for future extensibility and interpretability.

## Solution Overview
- Implement `initialize_agents.py` to provide logic for creating agents with default or custom trait descriptions, using the `AgentProfile` and trait classes.
- Implement `agent_manager.py` to wrap all agents in a simulation, exposing methods for access, update, and iteration, as described in the architecture doc.
- Integrate agent initialization and management into `simulation_manager.py`, so the simulation platform uses the new architecture for agent creation and management.
- Ensure all modules are modular, testable, and follow the single responsibility principle.
- Reference: `architecture/1_v1_design.md`, `agent/components/persistent/profile.py`, and trait modules.

## UI/UX Plan
- Not applicable for this backend-only feature.

## Implementation Checklist
- [x] Implement `initialize_agents.py` with logic for default and custom agent creation
- [x] Implement `agent_manager.py` with methods for agent access, update, and iteration
- [x] Integrate agent initialization and management into `simulation_manager.py`
- [ ] Add unit tests for agent initialization and management
- [ ] Document public APIs and usage examples
